DEVOPS TOOLING WEBSITE SOLUTION

In [project6](https://github.com/StrangeJay/DevOps_Project6) you implemented a WordPress-based solution that is ready to be filled with content and can be used as a full-fledged website/blog. Moving further we will add some more value to our solutions that your DevOps team could utilize. We want to introduce a set of DevOps tools that will help our team in day-to-day activities in managing, developing, testing, deploying and monitoring different projects.  

The tools we want our team to be able to use are well-known and widely used by multiple DevOps teams, so we will introduce a single DevOps Tooling Solution that will consist of: 

1. [Jenkins[(https://www.jenkins.io/) – free and open source automation server used to build [CI/CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD) pipelines. 
2. [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) – an open-source container-orchestration system for automating computer application deployment, scaling, and management.
3. [Jfrog Artifactory](https://jfrog.com/artifactory/) – Universal Repository Manager supporting all major packaging formats, build tools and CI servers. Artifactory.
4. [Rancher(https://rancher.com/products/rancher/) – an open-source software platform that enables organizations to run and manage [Docker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)) and Kubernetes in production.
5. [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) – a multi-platform open-source analytics and interactive visualization web application.
6. [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) – An open-source monitoring system with a dimensional data model, flexible query language, efficient time series database and modern alerting approach.
7. [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/kibana) – Kibana is a free and open user interface that lets you visualize your [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/) data and navigate the [Elastic Stack](https://www.elastic.co/elastic-stack).  

> **Note** Do not feel overwhelmed by the tools and technologies listed above, we will get ourselves familiar with them in upcoming projects!
